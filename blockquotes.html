<strong>Where do you currently work?
  <br> </strong>
I currently work as Head of Special Projects within the purchasing department in a supermarket chain in Ecuador called “
<a
  href="http://www.corporativo.tia.com.ec/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TIA</a>”, which is the the third largest in the country with 189 locations throughout Ecuador.
  <br>
  <br>

  <strong>What are some of your main responsibilities at your job?
    <br>
  </strong>
  My main duty is to work in the development of new suppliers for the company. I constantly look for new fruit and vegetables
  suppliers for the company, which offer quality products at good prices. I work closely with the Purchaser of Fruits and
  Vegetables and the Manager of Perishable Goods, who are in charge of the categories of Fruits & Vegetables and Meats. I
  am also leading a contracting farming project within the company, where we aim to eliminate the middlemen in the supply
  of fruits and vegetables and work closely with the farmers and producers in Ecuador so that we can obtain quality products,
  improve the useful life of products while reducing costs and offering our customers cheaper products.
  <br> I am also involved in a number of other projects such as being a member of the waste committee of the company, which looks
  to reduce the waste and costs in the handling of perishable goods in the company. I am also part of another project which
  aims to make the fruits and vegetables category in the company a “destination category”, which makes our customers visit
  our stores more frequently as we provide the best exhibition and fruits and vegetables in the market. I also work to find
  improvements and optimizations in the Perishable goods sector, by monitoring the monthly Budget compliance reports of the
  categories, a profit and loss statement to gain insight into the operation of the meats category of the company, etc.

  <strong>How did the MFRE program help you land your job?
    <br>
  </strong>
  The MFRE program gave me the knowledge and opportunity to learn policy analysis, financial tools to use in the agroindustry
  and its management, applied economic knowledge and how to apply it in the real world.
  <br>
  <br>

  <strong>Which skills learned at MFRE have helped you the most?
    <br>
  </strong>
  I think the financial tools in the agroindustry sector and the quantitative methods for business are the skills that have
  helped me the most in my current job.
  <br>
  <br>

  <strong>
    What would you say to a prospective student about the MFRE program?</strong>
  <br> It was a really great experience. You get to study and learn from great professors who possess knowledge and experience
  from both national and international aspects. Also, you have classmates not only from Canada, but from all over the world
  which gives you the valuable opportunity to share experiences and learn new cultures. The MFRE faculty was really helpful
  and they are always willing to give a hand and help students if they need additonal support in studies. Lastly, you get
  to experience Vancouver, which is a beautiful city with many things to do.
